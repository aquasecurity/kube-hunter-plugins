# kube-hunter-plugins
The following repo contains an official collection of kube-hunter plugins.
As well as documentations for how to create one yourselves.

## Intro
Due to the pluggable mechanism in kube-hunter (provided by the [pluggy package](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))  
You can add almost _any_ additional functionality to kube-hunter without diving into 
a large codebase.
By convention plugins should be a pypi package named with the following format:  
 `kube-hunter-example-plugin`

Plugins are functionalities that should not be included in the official implementations. it is there for users who wish to uniquely serve a specific solution for their private deployment. 
If you have an idea for a new functionality. feel free to create a PR to [kube-hunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter) directly. We encourage every contribution!

## Official plugins
The plugins that are featured here are:
| Name | Pypi Package Name | Details |
| --- | -- | -- | 
| hunting/arp_spoof_hunter | kube-hunter-arp-spoof | Registers a new hunter: ArpSpoofHunter|
| hunting/dns_spoof_hunter      | kube-hunter-dns-spoof | Registers a new hunter: DnsSpoofHunter |

    py_modules=["kube_hunter_your_plugin"],
)
```

### 2. plugin_entrypoint.py
Create a plugin_entrypoint.py for the package. containing the following:
```python
